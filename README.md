# 2DMD at a Glance: An easy access, manipulation, visualization, and analysis of dataset
The rational design of new materials, as well as materials with desired properties, is one of the central problems in modern computational chemistry and theoretical materials science. 
In turn, two-dimensional (2D) materials constitute an important subset of the whole library of all possible materials.
The 2D Material Defect (2DMD) [dataset] (https://rolos.com/open/2d-materials-point-defects/)  was created using density functional theory calculations to facilitate the application of machine learning methods and the development of new efficient data-driven approaches in the study and design of 2D materials.

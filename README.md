# 2DMD at a Glance: An easy access, manipulation, visualization, and analysis of dataset
Defects play a very important role in changing the mechanical, thermal, electronic, optical, and other properties of solids. Thus, individual defects can act as emitters of single photons, qubits, be used for single-atom catalysis, and subsequently be used in many other applications.
The 2D Material Defect (2DMD) dataset was created using density functional theory calculations to facilitate the application of machine learning methods and the development of new efficient data-driven approaches in the study and design of 2D materials.
